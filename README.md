# belly-button-challenge

Many thanks to my colleagues Nathan-Andrew Tompkins, Lois Stetson, and Martin Bedino for their input and help on this challenge. Also ChatGPT. Can't forget that wonderful tool. 


This web app was created to foster exploration of belly button bacteria data set through a dashboard that allows users to select different subjects to visualize what bacteria were present at the time of collection, and in what quantities.

The dashboard includes the top 10 bacteria, demographic information of the individual the sample was collected from, and a bubble chart to show the quanities of different bacteria.
